To install **Apache (HTTPD)** on an **Amazon Linux** instance, follow the steps below:

### **Steps to Install Apache on Amazon Linux**

1. **Connect to your EC2 instance**:
   - Use SSH to connect to your EC2 instance.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@<EC2-public-IP>
     ```

2. **Update the system packages**:
   - Before installing new software, ensure that all packages are up-to-date.
     ```bash
     sudo yum update -y
     ```

3. **Install Apache (HTTPD)**:
   - Use the following command to install the Apache web server:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install httpd -y
     ```

4. **Start the Apache service**:
   - Once Apache is installed, start the service using the command:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start httpd
     ```

5. **Enable Apache to start on boot**:
   - Ensure Apache starts automatically when the server is rebooted.
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl enable httpd
     ```

6. **Verify Apache Installation**:
   - You can verify if Apache is running by checking its status:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status httpd
     ```
   - Output should indicate that the service is **active (running)**.

7. **Adjust Firewall to Allow HTTP/HTTPS Traffic**:
   - Ensure that your **EC2 Security Group** allows inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and port 443 (HTTPS).
     - **Go to the EC2 Management Console**:
       - Select your instance.
       - Under **Security** > **Security Groups**, modify inbound rules to allow traffic on **port 80 (HTTP)** and **port 443 (HTTPS)**.
   
8. **Test Apache Installation**:
   - Once Apache is running, you can test the installation by opening your web browser and navigating to your instance's public IP address or domain name:
     ```
     http://<EC2-public-IP>
     ```
   - You should see the Apache default welcome page (or `/var/www/html/index.html` if youâ€™ve created one).

9. **Create or Modify Website Files**:
   - The default Apache web directory on Amazon Linux is `/var/www/html/`.
   - You can place or modify your website files in this directory:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html
     ```
